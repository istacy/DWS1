		<h1>Snowboarding</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Snowboarding is a winter sport that involves descending a slope that is covered with snow while standing on a board attached to a rider's feet, using a special boot set onto a mounted binding. The development of snowboarding was inspired by skateboarding, sledding, surfing and skiing. It was developed in the United States in the 1960s and became a Winter Olympic Sport in 1998.</p>

		<p class="jibbing">Jibbing is technical riding on non-standard surfaces, usually performing tricks. The word <abbr>"jib"</abbr> is both a noun and a verb, depending on the usage of the word. As a noun: a <em>jib</em> includes metal rails, boxes, benches, concrete ledges, walls, vehicles, rocks and logs. As a verb: to <em>jib</em> is referring to the action of jumping, sliding or riding on top of objects other than snow. It is directly influenced by grinding a skateboard. Jibbing is a freestyle snowboarding technique of riding. Typically jibbing occurs in a snowboard resort park but can also be done in urban environments.<br />
Freeride snowboarders also commonly find incidental jibs, such as a downed tree, that prove suitable to ride over in the course of their line or run.</p>

	<p class="freeriding">Free Riding is a general term for all-around snowboarding. <em>"Freeriding"</em> began as a marketing-derived term from the snowboarding industry, but it still has descriptive value. It communicates the concept of dynamically altering snowboarding styles on a continuous basis such that the combination becomes a style unto itself.<br />
To master freeriding is to seamlessly merge aspects of other snowboarding disciplines such as freestyle and alpine snowboarding into an all-around style - giving you the freedom to make the most of whatever terrain comes your way. Whereas freestyle snowboarding relies on the use of man-made terrain such as jumps, rails and half-pipes, and alpine snowboarding is done on groomed snow - the focus of freeriding is on utilising the random flow of natural terrain.</p>

		<legend><h3 id="freestyle">Free Style</h3></legend>
	<p class="freestyle">Freestyle snowboarding is any riding that includes performing tricks. In freestyle, the rider utilizes natural and man-made features such as rails, jumps, boxes, logs, rocks, and innumerable others to perform tricks. It is a popular all-inclusive concept that distinguishes the creative aspects of snowboarding, in contrast to a style like alpine snowboarding.<br />
Man made features are sometimes made to resemble street riding conditions such as a metal handrail and concrete staircase. The term "box" refers to an object with a slick top, usually of polyethylene <abbr>(HDPE)</abbr> plastic, that the rider can slide on with the base of their board. Like all freestyle features, boxes come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and difficulty levels. The intent of freestyle is to use these features to perform a number of aerial or jib tricks. This most commonly refers to tricks done on boxes, rails, or even trees.</p>

		<legend><h3 id="bigair">Big Air</h3></legend>
	<p class="bigair">Big air competitions are contests where riders perform tricks after launching off a man made jump built specifically for the event. Competitors perform tricks in the air, aiming to attain sizable height and distance, all while securing a clean landing. Many competitions also require the rider to do a trick to win the prize. Not all competitions call for a trick to win the gold; some intermittent competitions are based solely on height and distance of the launch of the snowboarder.</p>

		<legend><h3 id="halfpipe">Half Pipe</h3></legend>
	<p class="halfpipe">The half-pipe is a semi-circular ditch dug into the mountain or purpose built ramp made up of snow, with walls between 8 and 23 feet (7.0 m) competitors perform tricks while going from one side to the other and while in the air above the sides of the pipe.</p>

		<legend><h3 id="railjam">Rail Jam</h3></legend>
	<p class="railjam">A rail jam is a jib contest. Riders perform tricks on rails, boxes, pipes, wall rides, and several other creative features. Rail jams are done in a small area, usually with two or three choices of features for the rider to hit on a run. They are sometimes done in an urban setting, due to the relatively small amount of snow required. Scoring is done in the "jam" format, where every rider can take as many runs as time allows, usually around an hour; prizes are typically awarded for best overall and best trick in the male and female category.</p>
